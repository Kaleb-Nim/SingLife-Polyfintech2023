Dear Team,

I am writing to you concerning the attached Excel file, which indicates the missing vendor information for items 21400171, 21400181, 21400191, 21400161.

Could we possibly fill in the vendor information highlighted in red brackets?

During our meeting, it was mentioned that these components are not actually raw materials but intermediates. If that is the case, could we obtain the raw materials or intermediates for these four components, along with their corresponding vendor information? This should allow for a comprehensive mapping of the GC components.

Please note that the attached file was assembled by combining the GC_BOM with the MasterData.

Should any points require clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best Regards, 
Kaleb

emailAgent Suggestions:
1. Rather than using informal expressions like "FYI," use formal phrases like, "Please note that..." or "I'd like to advise that..."
Example: Change "FYI: The excel file attached was made by concatenating the GC_BOM with the MasterData." to "Please note, the attached Excel file was created by merging the GC_BOM with the MasterData."

2. Be more assertive when requesting action steps from your team.
Example: Change "Feel free to ask me if any clarification needed." to "Please do not hesitate to get in touch should you require any further clarification."

3. Pay close attention to punctuation and capitalization to maintain a professional tone in your message.
Example: "Is it possible to fill in the Vendor information highlighted in Red brackets?" should be, "Is it possible to fill in the vendor information highlighted in red brackets?"
